            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is now two Luſtres, or one Decade of years elapſed, and ſome more time, (gentle and courteous Reader,) ſince I hapned firſt to hit upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall kind of Menſuration (or more artificiall practicall Geometry for regular and regular-like Magnitudes,) which I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver: and which was then but in two or three Particulars thereof, here firſt of all laid down in the three principall Propoſitions contained in the firſt Part, and the ſame demonſtrated practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. And ſo having ſince by degrees, very
<pb facs="tcp:29488:4"/> much enlarged my Conceits &amp; inventions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (and indeed as far I think as poſſibly may be, &amp; that only by way of Mathematical exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; recreation from other Studies and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) I thought good at length, thus to put them together, (with other things by the way, pertinent thereto,) and ſo to exhibite and expoſe them to a publicke View, examination and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in generall, and in ſpeciall to thy candid and courteous cenſure: which I was the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened and encouraged to do, conſidering that when at firſt I propounded thoſe things which I had then conceived in this way, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall able Artiſts, not only in ſeverall parts of this Kingdome where I happened then to come, and with whom I had the opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but alſo in ſome parts beyond the Sea (where not long after I fortuned to ſpend ſome time, for the proſecuting of other Studies, which I then cheifly aymed at and intended, and have ſince for the part followed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced) moſt of which were Profeſſours and Teachers of the Mathematicks, and ſo ſuch as are uſually ſooneſt acquainted with all the new mathematicall inventions that are any way made known) I found that it was to them a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, (according as I conceived it would be) and that moreover at firſt they ſomewhat
<pb facs="tcp:29488:4"/> doubted of the ſame, ſaying, that it were indeed an excellent way, if it would generally certain and true; and ſo to ſome others of leſſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſeemed to be a thing ſo very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (they having made no triall thereof) as that they would ſuddenly and unadviſedly conclude it to be impoſſible, only that it might hit right now and then by chance, but not conſtantly.</p>
            <p>And then beſides this, I having for my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction herein, taken the pains (both at firſt, and alſo again of late) to make a ſtrict ſearch and enquiry into all the chiefeſt Authours which have hitherto treated of practicall Geometry ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Latin or Engliſh, and more eſpecially for inſtrumentall practice, in the way of manuall or mechanicall Menſuration; could not find the way here propoſed, ſo much as barely hinted by any of them in the leaſt kind. And ſo have I now here at length (by the favour and permiſſion of <hi>God)</hi> according to my earneſt deſire, brought that to a Generall, which at firſt I had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or apprehended only in a few Particulars, and ſo have compleated the Invention, as that I may think there is hardly any room left for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti on thereunto.</p>
            <p>Here then firſt (friendly and ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) ſhalt thou find the moſt artificiall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite quadrature of a Circle, in a practicall, or
<pb facs="tcp:29488:5"/> organicall way, as to the immediate obtaining of it's <hi>Area</hi> in any meaſure appointed. For as <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> ſaith of the ſquaring of a <hi>Circle</hi> in a generall way, (or of the generall quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Circle) Elem.

                  </gap>. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum quadrare, est Circuli areae aequale Rectiline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um invenire.</hi> that is, To ſquare a Circle, is to find a right-lined Plane equall to the Area of the Circle. Here ſhalt thou find that rectiline Plane to be the very Square of the Diameter, (or of the Circumference) according to Quantity diſcrete; in which it is artificially diminiſht by a Line of meaſure, ſo as to be made equall with the Circle it ſelf, whereas naturally or geometrically it is greater then the Circle. And ſo I may ſay, that more properly, preciſely and nearly to ſquare a <hi>Circle,</hi> is to find an exact Square equall to the Circle given: And the like underſtand for the ſquaring of any other regular Figure; and ſo thou ſhalt here find the like artificiall quadrature of all rectiline regular Planes as of a Circle, by their laterall, diametrall, and diagonall lines, for the immediate producing of their ſuperficiall contents, which I have here performed (by way of practicall demonſtration) in two of the firſt of them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:29488:5"/>
            <p>Then next ſhalt thou here find the like moſt artificiall and excellent cubing of a <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>Sphear,</hi> for the immediate producing of its ſolid content in any meaſure aſſigned. And what was ſaid before of the ſquaring of a <hi>Circle,</hi> both general and particular or ſpecial, the like I may ſay of the cubing of a <hi>Sphear;</hi> That the ſame generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; is to find a right-lined or plain <hi>Solid,</hi> equall to the ſolid Area of the <hi>Sphear:</hi> and ſo more particularly and properly, to cube a <hi>Sphear,</hi> is to find an exact Cube equall to the Spheare given; which thou ſhalt here find to be made ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially (in quantity arithmetical) the very Cube of the Diameter (or of the correſpondent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference) which naturally, or in quantity geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall, exceeds the Sphear it ſelf; and this not only in reſpect of ſolid meaſure, but alſo of gravity or ponderoſity, according to any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall aſſigned: And the like underſtand for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regular <hi>Solid:</hi> And ſo ſhalt thou here find the like moſt artificiall and admirable cubature of all the five famous plain ordinate Bodies in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or rectiline regular Solids, as of a Sphear, in both the foreſaid reſpects; and that not only as conſidered ſimply and abſolutely in themſelves alone, but alſo in relation to a Sphear, as being deſcribed either within or about the ſame. And what is here performed in all theſe regular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
<pb facs="tcp:29488:6"/> for their ſolid dimenſions, by way of cuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the like is done in them for their ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall dimenſions, by way of quadrature; (and which therefore I conceive, may not altogether unaptly and improperly be termed the Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe Bodies, as to their ſuperficiall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall part.)</p>
            <p>And then ſhalt thou here find after the like artificiall manner, the dimenſion both ſolid and ſuperficiall of all ſuch Solids, as are not exactly ordinate or regular, but ſomewhat like the ſame, and ſo which I call regular-like Solids, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right Cylinders and Cones; and all Priſms &amp; Pyramids conſtituted upon regular Baſes; and both which Dimenſions aforeſaid, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen in theſe kind of Bodies, to be arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially of the ſame nature with thoſe in exact regular Bodies: <hi>viz.</hi> cubatory and quadratary; as I ſhall ſhew in their Dimenſions; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in their ſolid Dimenſion, there is alwaies a Quadrature, in reſpect of the Baſe. And here likewiſe what is underſtood for ſolid meaſure, muſt be underſtood for gravity or weight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Metall propoſed.</p>
            <p>And all theſe ſeverall dimenſions afore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are here performed by Lines of equall parts only, according to a decumane, decimane, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimall diviſion, in which therefore conſiſteth
<pb facs="tcp:29488:6"/> the excellencie of the performance: and the ſame demonſtrated, not only in reſpect of the practicall uſe thereof, but alſo the theoricall grounds and reaſons, according to certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions laid down for that purpoſe. And which Lines are here generally ſet forth by Number, denoting or expreſſing their magnitudes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Meaſure given or appointed.</p>
            <p>And now, although that learned Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, Mr. <hi>Edm. Gunter</hi> (ſometime Profeſſour of Aſtronomy in <hi>Greſham-Colledge</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and long ſince deceaſed) a man excellent for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall inventions, hath (among other Lines) upon his <hi>Sector,</hi> certain Lines of quadrature, (as he termeth them) as for to make a <hi>Square</hi> equall to a <hi>Circle</hi> given, by the ſemidiameter thereof, <hi>&amp; contrà:</hi> and ſo for the like quadrature of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rectiline regular Planes, by their ſides; yet thoſe are of a much different kind and nature from ours, (as any one may plainly ſee) being not ſeverall Lines of meaſure divided into parts any way, whereby to give immediatly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſide of the equal <hi>Square</hi> arithmetically (as I may ſo ſpeak) or in quantity diſcrete, as from any certain, ſet, denominate Meaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a common way of meaſuring; as our Lines do, (&amp; conſequently, the ſuperficiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Square,</hi> for the Area of the Figure) but
<pb facs="tcp:29488:7"/> only one Line, drawn twice over upon the <hi>Sector;</hi> or (if you will) two like, correſpondent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruall Lines, drawn upon each leg or ſhank of the Sector, from the Center thereof, and undevided; containing in them only certain points, in which the <hi>Sector</hi> muſt be opened, according to the ſemidiameter of the Circle given, or the ſides of the other Figures to which they belong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there expreſſed by the numbers of their Sides; and ſo give the ſide of the equall Quadrat, only geometrically (as I may ſo ſpeake) or by Line, croſſing the Sector between the two points of quadrature at the ends thereof, and ſo parallel to the line for the ſemidiameter of the Circle, or ſide of other Figure, to which the Sector is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: and which line being taken off from thence with Compaſſes, and ſo applied to any certain Line of meaſure divided, will then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give the ſide of the equall Square in the parts of meaſure, as our Lines of quadrature do: but yet Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> doth not apply his Lines of quadrature to ſuch a uſe, or any way mention the ſame, but only to the laying down of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſide of the Square equall to a Circle given, &amp;c. and ſo to reduce the <hi>Circle</hi> into a <hi>Square,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrically, after a mechanicall manner: and which can hold but only in a ſmall Circle, whoſe ſemidiameter (or other ordinate Plane, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:29488:7"/> ſide) may not exceed a convenient extent or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the legs of the <hi>Sector,</hi> (or of a pair of Compaſſes) ſo as to take off the ſide of the equal Quadrat, in its due place upon the <hi>Sector:</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the largeſt <hi>Sector</hi> or <hi>Compaſſes</hi> that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, (or can be made convenient for uſe) will open or extend (at the utmoſt) but to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort line, in compariſon of thoſe which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall out to be meaſured; and therefore his Lines (or way) of Quadrature, cannot extend to any large Dimenſions, and ſo ſerve for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall meaſuring as ours do, if they ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the very ſame uſe that they are, namely, the ſuperficiall dimenſion of Circles, and other ordinate Planes, (in a quadratary way) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any meaſure aſſigned, and thereupon can ſerve but to very ſmall purpoſe. Nor indeed had lacquainted my ſelf with thoſe his Lines of Quadrature, or any other upon his Sector, when I firſt apprehended and conceived in my mind this artificiall way of meaſuring which I here propoſe, (though I had often ſeen that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had much ſtudied his Book in other things) nor till I had in a manner perfected the ſame throughout all the Dimenſions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereby, and ſo was come to the Cloſe of this Book. Neither did any of thoſe Artiſts, to whom I ever yet propounded the ſame (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid)
<pb facs="tcp:29488:8"/> mention to me thereupon in the leaſt kind, Mr. <hi>Gunter's</hi> Lines of quadrature (or any other upon his Sector) in reference to any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring; although ſome of them I am ſure (if not all) were well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Gunter's Sector,</hi> &amp; all his other Inſtruments, &amp; taught the uſe of them to others. But this only by the bye. Nor do his Lines of <hi>Superficies</hi> in generall, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sector,</hi> being alſo two like, congruall Lines drawn on the two leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereof from the Center, and divided unequally into 100 parts, ſerve for the meaſuring of Superficiall Figures, as to the immediate producing of their contents ſimply by themſelves, in any kind of meaſure given; but only in a way of proportion, to find out the ſuperficiall content of one Figure, by the ſuperficiall content of another like (or unlike) Figure given or known; together with ſeverall other uſes noted by him. And ſo his Lines of <hi>Solids</hi> in generall, being two like Lines, drawn upon the <hi>Sector</hi> in like manner, as the Lines of Superficies, and divided alſo into 100, (or rather 1000) parts unequally, ſerve only for the like uſes in Solids, that the Lines of Superficies do in Superficies.</p>
            <p>And then for his more particular Lines of Solids (as I may term them) upon the <hi>Sector,</hi> called the Lines of inſcribed, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
<pb facs="tcp:29488:8"/> bodies; having reference in particular to the five foreſaid plain regular Solids, and a Spheare: the firſt ſort of them, in reſpect of the inſcription of the ſaid five bodies in a Spheare; and the other ſort, in reſpect of their equation to a Spheare, and alſo of one to another; are of a different nature and kind from our artificiall Lines pertaining to theſe bodies, and a Spheare, for the immediate producing of their ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in any Meaſure appointed, according to an exact, abſolute cubature, both ſimply in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; alſo in reſpect of inſcription &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to a Sphear given, as aforeſaid: but are the firſt of them, for the finding of the Sides of theſe five bodies, as being to be inſcribed in a Sphear, by the ſemidiameter thereof given; and the other, for the finding of their Sides, as being equall in magnitude to a Sphear, and this by the Diameter of the Sphear given; <hi>&amp; contrà:</hi> or as to be made equall one to another by their ſides: and all this in a meer geometricall ſence; and thereupon theſe latter Lines of his, will give off from the <hi>Sector,</hi> the ſide of the <hi>Cube</hi> equall to a <hi>Sphear,</hi> by the Diameter thereof; &amp; to any of the other regular bodies, by the ſides thereof giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in the ſame manner, that his Lines of quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give the ſide of the <hi>Square</hi> equall to a <hi>Circle,</hi> by the ſemidiameter thereof, and to the other
<pb facs="tcp:29488:9"/> regular Planes or Superficies, by their ſides given; theſe Lines of equated bodies (as alſo thoſe of inſcribed bodies) being of the like kind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with thoſe of quadrature, (which by the ſame reaſon, may aſwell be called Lines of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Superficies, for that they do not only equall a <hi>Square</hi> to a <hi>Circle,</hi> or other ordinate Plane given; but alſo equall them all one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and are drawn upon the <hi>Sector</hi> accordingly; &amp; ſo are of no further or better uſe then they are.</p>
            <p>Then laſtly, his Lines of <hi>Metals</hi> (ſo called) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sector, (being inſerted with the lines of equated bodies, becauſe there was ſpare room, and much of the like kind with them, and ſo are contrived together on the ſame two lines, on each leg of the Sector, being drawn from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) are not like our lines of Metals (as I may ſo term them) which are for the immediate diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the weight of a Sphear, or other regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (or regular-like) body made of any Metall, in the very ſame (cubicall) manner, that their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid contents are obtained in any meaſure, by their reſpective artificiall Lines as aforeſaid; but thoſe (together with his Lines of Solids) do ſerve only to find the proportion, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeverall Metals (as he ſaith) in their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes and weights, and that according to the experiments of <hi>Marinus Ghetaldus,</hi> in his book
<pb facs="tcp:29488:9"/> intituled <hi>Archimedes promotus;</hi> that is (as he ſaith) In like Bodies of ſeverall Metals, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall magnitude, by having the weight of the one, to find the weight of the reſt; <hi>&amp; contrà:</hi> together with two other uſes noted by him.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (courteous and judicious Reader) I thought good here to inſert by the way from Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> to ſhew the difference between his Lines and ours; eſpecially thoſe of his, which for their uſe, may ſeem to come moſt nearly to ours, namely his Lines of Quadrature, and of equated Bodies: &amp; which as they cannot be ſo generally uſefull as (or not conſiderable for their uſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of) ours, according to what I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo neither can they be altogether ſo exact in the performance of thoſe ſmall Dimenſions which they can reach unto.</p>
            <p>And what I have here performed Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or by Line (or Scale) in an artificiall way of meaſuring; I have alſo ſet forth Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or by Number, in a way of Proportion after the moſt exquiſite manner that may be, as from the naturall Meaſure; according to the ſame diviſion or partition of the Unity, as is of the Lines of meaſure, both naturall and artificiall; and by which therefore the artificiall meaſure may be readily deduced from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or the naturall Meaſure be reduced to the
<pb facs="tcp:29488:10"/> artificiall: together with a multitude of other metricall concluſions beſides, in moſt of the geome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ricall Figures which I have here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly handled, by way of practicall demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; none of them having been done before by any man, that I do know of; except thoſe in the <hi>Circle,</hi> being ſet forth by Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> and from him by Mr. <hi>Wingate,</hi> and perhaps ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but yet not all of thoſe Proportions in ſo ample termes, as I have here done them, which therefore I extracted again a-new.</p>
            <p>And then moreover ſhalt thou here find, not only the moſt artificiall and expeditionall way of meaſuring thus all regular Bodies, and ſuch as do come very near a regular forme (which therefore I call regular-like) but alſo of ſuch as are of an irregular form; and firſt, of concave Bodies, or Veſſels for Wine and Beer, (which commonly do ſomewhat imitate the form of a Cylinder, and may be called Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droidall, and ſo admit of a Cylinder-like dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being firſt reduced by art to a Cylinder: to which end I beſtowed ſome conſiderable pains (and a little coſt too) in the making of ſundry experimiments, for the diſcovering of the true contents of the Standard-meaſures for Wine and Ale or Beer, pertaining to the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (which are kept at the <hi>Guild-hall)</hi> as being
<pb facs="tcp:29488:10"/> commonly taken for the moſt generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Meaſures for this purpoſe, throughout the Kingdome; and by which I have ſeen the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which have been made for ſome eminent Towns farr remote from <hi>London,</hi> to be ſized and ſealed, (though here I wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend about them) and have here accordingly fitted a gauging-Line to each of them, according to our artificiall way of meaſuring, being alſo therefore Lines or Scales of equall parts in a decimall diviſion, by which the liquid content of any Veſſell will be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediatly in Gallon-meaſure, after the ſame manner (and with the ſame expedition in a manner, the irregularity of the Veſſell being conſidered) that the ſolid content of any exact Cylinder is had artificially, according to any Meaſure appointed.</p>
            <p>And then laſt of all, do I here ſhew (by way of Appendix) the moſt eaſie and exact way for the diſcovering of the ſolid capacities of all other irregular kinds of Bodies whatſoever, both ſolid and concave, which of themſelves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unmeaſurable in the uſuall way of meaſuring (or whoſe Dimenſions can in no wiſe be taken by a Line of meaſure) which therefore is a work of a contrary nature to all the former: and have here exemplarily illuſtrated the ſame from experiment, in a certaine regular ſolid body,
<pb facs="tcp:29488:11"/> eaſily and exactly meaſurable, for a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; (and which way alſo, hathnot been ſet forth by any man before, that I do know of) Together with ſeverall other new mathematicall experiments and obſervations, very uſefull, and worth the noting. All which (friendly Reader) I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend to thy courteous conſideration &amp; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; hoping thou wilt receive no leſſe delight (and benefit alſo) in the peruſing and practiſing hereof, then I have taken delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſtudy and exerciſe of the ſame, though ſurely with no ſmall pains and induſtry, beſide the expence of ſome time now and then, from my occaſions of ſerious concernment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſame would reaſonably permit: and which therefore I could do to no other end, then only to enlarge and advance (ſo farr as here I might) the practice and exerciſe of this ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and admirable an Art, being drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by that <hi>Genius,</hi> which hath heretofore much diſpoſed and inclined me to mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall contemplation and exercitation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: ſo that, thy friendly acceptation hereof, is all I expect for my labour. And if any after me ſhall happen to raiſe any further Concluſions from what I have here laid down, in any particular thereof; then ſurely will theſe my paines be yet thereupon ſo much the more to purpoſe. But
<pb facs="tcp:29488:11"/> now as I muſt expect this work of mine will meet with ſome <hi>Momaicall</hi> or <hi>Zoilan</hi> Spirit, ſo I ſhal not regard the ſame, or be terrified thereat, ſeeing that the beſt conceits and inventions of men that were ever yet publiſhed to the world, have been obnoxious to the obloquies and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectations of ſuch malevolent and malignant ſpirits: and which hath been the complainr of the moſt learned men in all ages.

                  <p>Now the Geometricall Figures which we have here firſt named, and ſo for which we have firſt extracted theſe kinde of metricall lines (or linear numbers) are thoſe foure which <hi>Archimedes</hi> himſelfe more eſpecially treated of, and which are as it were, the beginning and ground of all the reſt, namely, the <hi>Circle, Spheare, Cylinder</hi> and <hi>Cone,</hi> and accordingly the like Lines may be extracted for all ordinate Planes and Solids whatſoever, as we afterwards ſhew; for that to theſe foure may be aptly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all other regular and regular-like Figures; As to the Circle may be aptly referred all ordinate Planes, to the Sphear, all exactly ordinate Solids; to the Cylinder,

                     <p>And here obſerve, that as in the Circle and Sphear, we ſhewed, how that the ſuperficiality of the one, and both the ſuperficiality and ſolidity of the other, were obtained artificially, not only by the bare Quadration and Cubation of their Diameters, but alſo of their Circumferences, by the like artificiall Lines of meaſure accommodated to them: So likewiſe in the Cylinder and Cone, may the ſolidity be had, not only by the induction, implication, or involution
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29488:35"/> of the Quadrat of their Baſiall Diameter into their Axis (as we have already ſhewed in both of them) but alſo of the Quadrat of their Baſiall circumference into their Axis, theſe being (both of them,) <note place="margin">The ſolid dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Cylinder and Cone by their Baſiall Periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their Axes together. And the artificial Lines of meaſure for the ſame.</note> taken by one and the ſame Line of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: So the Line for ſquaring the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (of the Baſe) of a Cylinder, (for its Baſe) will be of the Rationall Line, 2.32489: and for ſquaring the Baſiall circumference of a Cone, 3.3531; which two Lines being divided as the former, and the Baſial circumferences (as alſo the Axes) of theſe two Bodies taken thereby, may ſomtimes prove to be of more ſatisfaction then thoſe for the baſiall Diameters, to wit, where the baſiall centers of theſe Bodies are not apparent, (eſpecially if the Baſes of the Cylinder or Cone to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured be very large) according as I noted before in the Circle and Sphear. But indeed, where the Diameters may be firſt exactly taken, either in theſe two Figures, or in the other two before going, it will be much eaſier and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in practiſe, then by the Circumferences, in regard both, that the artificiall Lines of meaſure ſerving thereunto, are much ſhorter, and alſo that the Diametrall numbers being much leſſer or ſmaller then the circumferentiall, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical operations following thereupon, in caſting up the ſuperficiall and ſolid contents, wil be ſooner expedited, unleſſe the ſame be performed Geometrically (as I may term it) or Inſtrumentally, <hi>viz.</hi> by Scale and Compaſſes, or the like (as I ſhall in the very cloſe of this Book by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion declare) for then the latter may be performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, even as ſoon as the former.</p>
                     <p>And now you may obſerve here by the way, how that although the baſe of a Cylinder and Cone be a Circle, and its Area be here had alſo, by the only quadration
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29488:36"/> of the Diameter or Circumference, as before was done in the Circle, whereby the ſame artificiall Lines of meaſure that are there uſed, might alſo perhaps ſeem to ſerve here, (and which indeed in ſome ſort may, as I ſhall ſtraight way ſhew) yet for the obtaining of the ſolidities of theſe Bodies, by the implication or induction of the Quadrat of their Baſial Diameter or Circumference into their Axis (either of theſe two baſiall Lines, with the Axis, in each of theſe two Bodies, being taken by one and the ſame proper, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, artificiall Line of meaſure, as before hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhewed) the Lines there appropriated to a Circle cannot here hold for their Baſes; for the Diameters or Circumferences here of being taken by thoſe Lines, wil be either greater or leſſer (in the number or parts of meaſure; according to quantity diſcrete) then by their own proper Lines; (and ſo their Quadrats for the Baſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſolid contents wil be greater or leſſer then they ought to be; what artificiall Line of meaſure ſoever, the Axis ſhould be meaſured by.) For ſo in a Cylinder and Cone, the Diameter of the Baſe being taken by the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Line belonging to the Diameter of a Circle, for its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate dimenſion thereby (being ſimply and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe alone as a Circle) will be found in the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder to be ſomwhat leſſe, and in the Cone much greater, (in the number or parts of meaſure, as in a Quantity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete) then being taken by its proper artificiall Line for the quadrate dimenſion of the Baſe, as in reference to the ſolid dimenſion of the Cylinder and Cone, performed wholly by the ſaid Line of Meaſure, from the Baſiall Diameter and the Axis together.</p>
                     <p>And then, both in a Cylinder and Cone, the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Baſe being taken by the artificiall Line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the circumference of a Circle ſimply, for its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate dimenſion thereby; will be found leſſe (as falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29488:36"/> the notion or nature of a Quantity diſcrete, as aforeſaid) then by its proper, reſpective, artificiall Line, for the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the baſe thereby, as in relation to the ſolid dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Cylinder and Cone, wholly performed by the ſaid Line, from the Baſiall Circumference, and the Axis together.</p>
                     <p>As in the Cylinder and Cone laſt handled; where the Diameter of the Baſe being put naturally <hi>(A B)</hi> 7.00, the ſame was there found to be artificially <hi>(G H)</hi> 6.46 <hi>ferè,</hi> and <hi>(I K)</hi> 4.48 <hi>ferè,</hi> and which will be found by the Line (of Quadrature) pertaining to the Diameter of a Circle, ſimply <hi>(C D)</hi> to be 6.20, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomwhat leſſe then that of <hi>G H,</hi> and much greater then that of <hi>I K.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo there again, the Circumference of the Baſe being naturally <hi>(A B)</hi> 22 <hi>ferè;</hi> the ſame will be found to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, by the Line for ſquaring the (Baſiall) Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Cylinder (as in reference to its ſolid dimenſion by the Circumference and Axis together) 9.46; and by the Line for ſquaring the baſiall Circumference of a Cone (as in relation to its ſolid dimenſion in the like manner) 6.56, and which by the Line for the Circumferentiall quadrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Circle, ſimply, will be found 6.20 (as the Diameter before, by its proper Line of quadrature (C D) which is leſſe then either of the other.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, if the baſiall Diameter or Circumference of a Cylinder and Cone, be taken by the Lines of (Diametrall and Circumferentiall) quadration, properly, peculiarly, and ſimply pertaining to a Circle, and ſo its Quadrat be made the Baſe of the Cylinder or Cone; then muſt the Axis be taken by the Prime Rationall Line: (And ſo the dimenſion will be mixt.) For that here the Area of the Baſe, will fall immediately, in the true, naturall, meaſure, (as under the dimenſionall reaſon of the prime, true, or naturall Rational
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29488:37"/> Line) according as hath been demonſtrated before in the dimenſion of a Circle.</p>
                     <p>As here the Baſiall diameter of the Cylinder and Cone, naturally <hi>(A B)</hi> 7.00 taken by the Line <hi>C D</hi> is 6.20 (or 6.2, as I ſhewed even now) whoſe Quadrat. 38.4400 (or 38.44 only) for the Baſe, (which was found before, to be moſt truly and naturally, 38.4845) being drawn into the Axis, put before, naturally, <hi>(A B)</hi> 12.00, will give the Cylindricall ſolidity (in the dimenſionall reaſon of <hi>A B)</hi> 461.280000, (or 461.28 only) and ſo the Conicall ſolidity, 153.76; which differ (by way of defect) from the true, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſolidities (produced wholly by the Line <hi>A B) viz.</hi> of the Cylinder, 461.814120, about 1/2 of a cubique Integer or Unit, as of <hi>A B</hi> cubed: and ſo of the Cone, <hi>viz.</hi> 153.938040, about 1/6 of a cube-integer only, as of the ſame Line Cubed; And the ſolidity of the Cylinder, produced artificially by its proper Line of meaſure <hi>(G H) viz.</hi> 461.968812 <hi>ferè,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth therefrom (by way of exceſſe) only about 1/6 of a cube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integer; and the ſolidity of the Cone produced in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by its proper artificiall Line of meaſure <hi>(I K) viz.</hi> 154.140672 <hi>ferè,</hi> only about 1/5 of a cubique or ſolid Integer of the naturall meaſure (as of <hi>A B</hi> conſidered cubically) as before hath been ſhewed,</p>
                     <p>All which ſeverall ſolid dimenſions (both naturall and artificiall, and mixt of both) doe ſo neerly agree one with another, as that their differences are altogether inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And the ſame will happen in the ſolid dimenſions of theſe two Bodies, by the other Line of Quadrature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſimply to a Circle, as to the quadration of their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiall Peripheries, for their baſiall Area's, and withall by the prime or naturall Rationall Line, as to the dimenſion of their Axes or Altitudes.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:29488:37"/>
                     <p>And now, as for the Axis (or Altitude) of a right or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Cone, you may here obſerve, that though the ſame cannot immediately be taken Inſtrumentally; or by a Line of Meaſure (as it is within the body of the Cone) as that of a Cylinder (being parallel to, and ſo agreeable with the ſide,) by reaſon of the inequality of its Body betweene the Baſe and the Cuſpe, or verticall point; but being obtained purely Geometrically, muſt be had by mediation of the Side (as being the ſide of a rectiline rectangle Triangle, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the right angle, and therefore potentially equall, or equally potent to the two containing, comprehending, or including ſides. by E. 1. p. 47.) and of the baſiall Ray, (being one of the ſides about the right angle (and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the leſſer,) and ſo the ſide of the Cone, and the radial line of its baſe, being firſt taken Inſtrumentally or Mechanical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Axis will be had Trigonometrically, according to the reaſon of the fore-cited <hi>prop.</hi> of <hi>Euclid.)</hi> Yet may the ſame be obtained moſt readily (out of the Cone) by a Line of meaſure, if from a Plane conſtituted in the top, or verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point of the Cone, parallel to the Baſe, you let down a Perpendicular-line to the Plane on which the Baſe is, (and which may fall preciſely upon the Baſiall periphery) for that (being meaſured) ſhall be equall to the true Axis of the Cone. And thus alſo may the altitude of any oblique, ſcalene, or inclined Cone be taken; and alſo of an oblique, ſcalene, or inclined Cylinder; if from the top of the Cone to the Plane in which the Baſe is ſet, or from the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our baſe of the Cylinder, to the Plane of the inferiour baſe, be let fall a perpendicular-line; for that (being meaſured) ſhall be the altitude of the oblique, or inclined Cylinder or Cone; and ſo being infolded with the whole baſe, if a Cylinder (whether meaſured by the naturall or the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Line of meaſure) ſhall make the ſolidity of the ſame: or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29488:38"/> being infolded with a trient of the baſe, if a Cone, (or the baſe with a trient of that) and meaſured by the naturall Line; or elſe the whole perpendicular of altitude with the whole baſe, if meaſured by the artificiall Line proper to a Cone, ſhall produce the ſolidity of the oblique Cone; ſeeing that ſuch a Cylinder and Cone, is equall to a right Cylinder and Cone, having the ſame baſe and alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">See alſo <hi>E.</hi> 11. p. 31, &amp; <hi>E.</hi> 1. p. 35, 36, 37, 38.</note> with it, (according to the reaſon of E. 12. p. 11, &amp; p. 14.)</p>
                     <p>And after the ſame manner will the true altitude of any Pyramid, whether right or oblique, be had, as of a right or oblique Cone, and the altitude of an oblique or inclined Priſme, as of an oblique or inclined Cylinder; the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which bodies, eſpecially the Pyramidal (both ſolidly and ſuperficially) according to our new artificiall way (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the naturall or vulgar, by way of dimenſionall compariſon) I ſhall ſhew next after the dimenſion of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined ordinate Planes or Superficies, ſeeing that upon any of them may be erected or conſtituted a Pyramid or Priſme; as a Cone or Cylinder upon a Circle.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd as we have here ſhewed the moſt artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and expeditious dimenſion of the Cylinder and Cone, in reſpect of their <hi>Stereometry,</hi> or ſolid meaſure; ſo we ſhall likewiſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their dimenſions in reſpect of <hi>Planome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> or ſuperficiall Meaſure. And the artificiall Lines for the performing hereof, I finde, for the Cylinder, (in reſpect of its Diameter &amp; Side together) to be of the prime Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Line, the ſame with that which was formerly found to be for the obtaining of the Superficies of a Sphear, by the only quadration of the Diameter, <hi>viz.</hi> 0.564, &amp;c. And for the Cone (in relation to its baſiall diameter, &amp; its ſide conjunctly) 0.79788 (which according to the parts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, is as A B 1.00000—.20212) and in relation to its baſiall periphery and ſide together, it will be 1.4142, &amp;c, <hi>(viz. √q 2)</hi> which ſeverall Lines being exactly ſet off from the prime Rationall Line, and then divided as the ſame, and ſo the baſiall diameter, and the ſide of a Cylinder, and of a Cone; and alſo the baſiall Circumference, and the ſide of a Cone together, be taken by their peculiar, reſpective, diſtinct artificiall Lines of Meaſure, and ſo multiplyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their ſeverall products ſhall be the ſuperficiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Cylinder and Cone, according to the prime Rationall Line: where, by the ſuperficies of a Cylinder
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29488:39"/> and Cone, muſt be underſtood without their Baſes; for ſo the Superficies of theſe two Solids are generally taken by Artiſts, and are called by the Latin Geometers, eſpecialy <hi>Ramus,</hi> (in one word) <hi>Cylindraceum,</hi> and <hi>Conicum,</hi> that is as much as to ſay in Engliſh, the Cylindraceall or Cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and the Conicall; and ſo the Superficies of a Spheare is called by them <hi>Sphaericum, viz.</hi> the Sphericall. But now for a briefe dilucidation of theſe ſuperficiall dimenſions in the Cylinder and Cone, I ſhall lay down an example in each of theſe three artificiall Metricall Lines (though here I do not draw them, but only expreſſe them by number) whereby the verity of theſe our dimenſions alſo, may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, to thoſe that ſhall pleaſe to make tryall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And firſt we may hereupon raiſe this practicall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>If the (baſiall) Diameter, and the Side of a right Cylinder; And the baſiall Diameter or Periphery, and the Side of a right Cone, be taken by their proper and peculiar, diſtinct artificiall Lines of Meaſure, and the ſame be ſeverally infolded together: That the reſulting rectangle <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram,</hi> ſhall be equall to the Cylindricall and Conicall Superficies, (according to the reaſon of the prime Rationall Line.)</q>
                  <p>THerefore, ſuppoſe here firſt the Cylinder laſt handled, whoſe Diameter was put (of the Prime Rational Line) exactly 7, and ſo the Circumference (according to the moſt common Cycloperimetricall terms) was exactly 22, and the altitude (which is the ſame with the ſide) was put exactly 12, and theſe two infolded together, do produce the Superficies of the Cylinder (without the two Baſes) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, 264: whereby this Cylinder becomes abſolute in all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29488:39"/> its dimenſions; But by the other Cycloperimetricall terms, the Circumference was but 21.99 &amp;c.

And if the firſt or naturall Line of meaſure be made 1000, and ſo the ſecond or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Line (being thereof 0.564) be alſo made 1000, then the ſaid Diameter taken thereby, wil be 12.407, and the Side wil be 21.269, which two multiplyed together, will produce the Cylindrical Superfice, 263.884483, differing from the true one, <hi>viz.</hi> 263.893783 (now by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) only as 1/108 <hi>ferè,</hi> of a ſquare integer or unit of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meaſure.

And ſo contrarily, will the Analogie hold from the double of the Baſe, or the two baſes conjunctly (76 219/226, or 76.9690 &amp;c.) to the Cylindrical Superficies (263 101/113 or 263.89378 &amp;c.) as from the Radius of the Baſe (3 1/2 or 3.5) to the ſide of the Cylinder (12.) And laſtly, if to the foreſaid Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dricall Superficies 263 101/113, or 263.8938 <hi>ferè,</hi> you adde the aggregate of the two Baſes, 76 219/226, or 76.9690, you will have the total externall ſuperficies of the Cylinder, 340 195/116, or 340.8628 <hi>ferè,</hi> which by the moſt vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,

                  <p>But now for a more ſpeedy dimenſion of the Superficies of the foregoing Cone, and firſt by the Side and baſial dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter only, together: I ſay, that if the ſide of the Cone (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally 12) be meaſured by its proper Line of Meaſure for this purpoſe (which is in centeſimal parts only of the prime Rational Line, 0.80 <hi>ferè)</hi> under a centeſimal ſolution; the ſame wil be found thereby, 15.04; and the baſial Diameter (naturally 7) meaſured by the ſame Line, will be found 8.77, which two being multiplyed together, do produce 131.9008, for the Conical Superfice, which wants of the true content, only 1/22 <hi>ferè</hi> of a ſquare or ſuperficial Integer or Unit of the Meaſure firſt aſſigned. And ſo again, if the baſial Periphery of this Cone, naturally, 22 <hi>ferè:</hi> be taken by its proper, reſpective, artificial Line of Meaſure for this purpoſe, (being of the prime Rational Line, in a centeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſolution, 1.41) centeſimally divided; the ſame wil be found thereby, 15.56 <hi>ferè:</hi> and the Side of the Cone being alſo taken by the ſame Line, will be found 8.48; which two multiplyed together, do yeild 131.9488 <hi>ferè,</hi> for the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Cone, which agreeth ſomwhat more neerly with the true Conical, <hi>viz.</hi> 131.9469, then that which was produced in this kinde by the baſiall Diameter and the Side together, <hi>viz.</hi> 131.9008. for this latter (by the baſial periphery and the Side) differeth from the true one (by way of exceſſe or redundancie) but 19 ſquare or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial centeſms <hi>ferè, viz.</hi> 19 of 10000, which in a vulgar Arithmetical expreſſion, are hardly 1/526 of the prime Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Line (as the Integer or Unit of meaſure) ſquared: ſo that both theſe wayes for the finding of the ſuperficies of a Cone, conſiſt alſo but of one Multiplication only, as that for the Cylinder.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:29488:42"/>
                  <p>But for finding the ſuperficies of a Cylinder in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by an artificiall Line of meaſure, peculiarly fitted to the Circumference and Side together, the ſame is not to be done, ſeeing it is performed immediately by the naturall Line of meaſure, or the Prime Rationall Line it ſelfe, with the ſame expedition as that in the Cone by an Artificiall Line; for that the Plane made of the Circumference and Side of the Cylinder, taken by the prime or natural Line of meaſure firſt appointed (according as I ſaid at firſt) doth conſtitute the true Cylindraceall, or the Cylindricall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And ſo from the premiſſes it appears, that as a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder in regard of ſolid dimenſion, is the triple of a Cone having the ſame Baſe and Axis, or Altitude: So in reſpect of ſuperficiary dimenſion, it is the double of a Cone having the ſame Baſe and Side or Longitude.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Baſes of a Cylinder and Cone, if they be required in their ſuperficiary dimenſions, the ſame may moſt readily be obtained by either of the Lines of Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pertaining to a Circle, according as the Diameter or Circumference thereof ſhall happen to be taken: For ſo the baſiall Diameter or Circumference of the foregoing Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Cone (naturally 7.00, and 22 <hi>ferè, viz.</hi> 21.99) being meaſured by the ſaid Lines of diametrall and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentiall quadration (under a centeſimall ſolution) will be found each of them ſeverally; to be 6.20 (as I noted before in their ſolid dimenſions) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſquared, yeilds 38.4400 for the Baſe; and the true baſe was formerly found, 38.4845; from which ours differs, (by way of defect) not ſo much as will make in vulgar terms, 1/22 of a ſquare Integer or Unit.</p>
                  <p>And thus having ſufficiently declared and demonſtrated the dimenſion both Solid and Superficiall of a Cylinder and Cone (both theorically, and) practically, according to the Inſtrumentall part of Geometry; and that as well naturally

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now again, as for the differences happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the ſuperficiall and ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Figures, found by the naturall or vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way of meaſuring, and our artificial way; we have formerly ſhewed, how ſmall and inconſiderable they generally are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo the practical, inſtrumental (or Geometricall) reaſon thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſeverall Lines of dimenſion in the ſeverall Figures (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally belonging to them, or artificially and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abſcribed to them) as namely, the Diameters and Circumferences of the Circle and Sphear; and ſo the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters. Circumferences and Axes, or Altitudes, and Sides, of the Cylinder and Cone, before going, (and ſo of all the other Figures following reſpectively) taken by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, reſpective artificiall Lines of Meaſure, are ſeldome or never exact and preciſe indeed in the parts of meaſure, but either deficient or redundant in the ſame, and ſo give the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29488:44"/> are all contents of thoſe figures either a little leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then indeed they are (though for the moſt partleſſe, eſpecially in the two firſt decimal partitions of the Lines of meaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> into Centeſms, or only into prime or ſimple Decimal parts, or Tenths) as appeared formerly (and will alſo afterwards) by a continuall decimall augmentation (or ſubdecuplation) of the parts of thoſe Lines, whereby the Contents were had ſtill neerer to the truth; Which reaſon ariſeth from (and ſo dependeth upon) the more true, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, theoricall (or the Arithmetical) reaſon of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, lying in the extraction of the Square and Cube-Roots: For that the Roots of numbers not exactly Square and Cubical, cannot be exactly had, but are alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, ſo as that they being inverted, or drawn again into themſelves, do not render the numbers preciſely, out of which they were extracted; but the further that the extraction is extended or continued decimally, by the adjection or appoſition of more Figures, (or of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers where there is need) the neerer ſtill to the truth will the Root be had; as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the <note n="*" place="margin">Where I might alſo have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed one thing more (to the young practitioner) amongſt other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars concerning the decimal ſolution of Unity, (and which I may here, not altogether un-opportunely do, though it be there included and underſtood in the Generall,) <hi>viz.</hi> That thereby, all the tedious and troubleſome operations of Arithmetick in Fractions, by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way, are wholly avoyded: for that here all fractional numbers, whether comming alone by themſelves, or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with integrall numbers, are wholly and univerſally wrought as integrals, without any manner of preparatory ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (as Reduction or tranſmutation of terms, one way or other,) which in the working of vulgar Fractions is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required.</note> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where I took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of the excellencie of Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Arithmetick, as in reference to the work in hand: So that what errour (though inconſiderable) may at any time ariſe in our work, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29488:45"/> primarily and principally from the extraction of the Square and Cube-Roots; our artificiall Lines of meaſure giving immediately the Square and Cube-Roots of the Figures to which they are appropriated and applyed, (or the ſides of their equall Squares and Cubes, as nearly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as may be) according as their dimenſion is ſuperficial or ſolid, as being naturally (as it were) procreated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them; except it be in the Cylinder and Cone, and the other regular-like Solids following; as regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed Pyramids and Priſms: but elſe in all truly ordinate Superficies and Solids; as the Circle and Spheare before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and ſo the equiterminall and equiangular Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Solids following, it holdeth ſo: And ſo likewiſe in the Cylinder and Cone, and other regular-like Solids, both for ſolid and ſuperficiarie dimenſion, where there is a congruity between their Lines of dimenſion, by which their ſolid and ſuperficial Conetnts are obtained, as the Diameters, Peripheries, Sides, and other dimenſionall Lines of their Baſes with their Axes or Altitudes for ſolid dimenſion, and with the ſides of their Bodies for ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dimenſion. And therefore if there were no defection in the aforeſaid Radicall extractions, there would be none in our work; for that all our artificiall Lines of meaſure (or Lines of artificiall meaſure) being thus Radically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, are themſelves in the nature of Roots quadrate and cubique. And ſo alſo, all the Numbers or Terms of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature and Cubature, &amp;c, by which the ſides of the equall Squares and Cubes of Figures, (in the naturall Menſurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and alſo ſome other particular lines, or numbers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion, in the artificiall Meaſure, deduced from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall) are proportionally obtained ſeverall wayes (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to unity) as from their ſeverall lines of dimenſion before named (and which alſo are immediately given by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29488:45"/> our artificiall Lines of meaſure) are produced by Radical extraction, from the reſpective figures, to whoſe dimenſion (ſuperficiall or ſolid) they ſerve, as being their Roots, or the ſides of their equall Squares and Cubes, according to their foreſaid ſeverall dimenſionall Lines, put unitly. But indeed, the greateſt errour that can commonly ariſe here, (in reſpect of the difference of our meaſure from the true meaſure, whether ſuperficiall or ſolid,) will be of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I have ſhewed before (and ſhall alſo ſhew after) in ſeverall examples. And if our meaſure agree with the true meaſure, but exactly to integers or units (as it almoſt always doth, and much neerer alſo; as even to ſmall parts of an Integer or unit, (ſuperficiall or ſolid) of the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Meaſure) it will be ſufficient in any matter of mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Menſurations; for which, this our artificiall way of Meaſuring, was chiefely deviſed and intended.</p>
                  <p>But now further, as to the ground and reaſon, briefly, of this kinde of dimenſion (or of theſe artificial metricall Lines,) the ſame may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">Concerning the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall meaſure in generall.</note> to be two-fold, to wit, generall or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall; and ſpeciall or particular; that conſiſting in Unity alone; this in the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Unity: For the generall reaſon is by it ſelfe abſolute, ſimple, and certain, without relation or limitation to any the proper, compounding, denominate (or other) parts of the Rationall Line, (as being the Integer or Unit of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) but conſidereth the ſame generally (and abſolutely in it ſelfe) as ſome one entire or whole thing, (of which I ſhall (God willing) ſpeake more fully afterwards, in the cloſe of the ſecond part of this Book, as being a place conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.)

And which Lines therefore being moſt properly conſidered and laid down from the foreſaid parts of the natural Meaſures appointed, (as before, the Lines are from the whole intire Meaſures themſelves) will alter continually in every particular Figure, (in reſpect of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity diſcrete, according to their Arithmeticall Indices or Exponents, which expreſſe their magnitudes in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named parts of Meaſure) not only in regard of the different dimenſionall lines thereof, by which it may be propounded to be artificially meaſured, as aforeſaid, and ſo to which they are reſpectively fitted: (as the artificiall Lines before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned do, according to their like Indices or Exponents before declared; eſpecially for the moſt part; though it doth happen otherwiſe ſomtimes, as that one and the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall Line, is found either wholly throughout, or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in part, (that is, in reſpect of the fractionall or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall part of the naturall Line of meaſure, from which it is taken, ſhewed by the Arithmeticall Index or Exponent,

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29488:48"/> which they do artificially repreſent, and conſequently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which (chiefly) they give the ſuperficiall and ſolid contents of Figures (as aforeſaid.) And which Lines (for the reaſons before alleadged, as alſo for diſtinctior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake) we may well call, the particular or ſecond artificiall Lines (or the Lines of parts) as the other may be called the prime or integrall artificiall Lines (or Lines of the Whole) And ſo the Meaſure ariſing there from may accordingly be called, the one, the prime or integrall Meaſure (or Meaſure of the Whole) as having its denomination ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely from the whole intire naturall Line of Meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: And the other the particular or partiall Meaſure (or Meaſure of the parts) as being denominated chiefly from the parts of the ſaid Line of Meaſure.)

So that theſe ſecond Lines are never exactly decimall, as the prime Lines perpetually are, unleſſe it happen, that the prime or compounding parts of the naturall Meaſure appointed be in a decimall number, for then as the naturall Line, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the correſpondent particular, or ſecondary artificiall Line will be exactly decimall; their ſaid prime parts being divided decimally; but yet however, they do generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Dimenſions wrought by them, after a decimal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (though ſecondarily, <hi>viz.</hi> after a reduction of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taken by them, into their prime parts, &amp;c. As firſt (for example) in the naturall Menſuration; the moſt common, mechanicall way of meaſuring by the foot with us, is, as the ſame is vulgarly divided into 12 Inches, which are, as its compoſing, denominate, or Geometricall parts (for ſo every meaſure is commonly ſaid to be divided into the parts, of which it is prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29488:55"/> or natural way of meaſuring,) <hi>viz.</hi> in that, as there the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea is had immediatly by the only ſquaring of ſome one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſional line of the Triangle, as the Side or Perpendicular, &amp;c. and ſo the ſame is the Quadrat thereof in Quantity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical or meaſure numeral: here it will be the Rectangle made of the whole Baſe and Perpendicular together (as it is naturally and really the half of that Rectangle, by <hi>E. 1. p.</hi> 41. before cited) which two lines, if they happen at any time to be equal, then will the Area be produced under the form of a perfect Quadrat, from either of them, as that of an <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleuron,</hi> or regular Trigon; ſeeing that the Rectangle made of them both, is no other then the exact Quadrat of either of them ſingly: And ſo therefore, after this latter way may an <hi>Iſopleuron</hi> alſo be artificially meaſured, the way being general. And this reſembles the artificial dimenſion both ſolid and ſuperficial of regular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like Solids, as the Cone, and all regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-baſed Pyramids, &amp;c. and ſo differeth from that particular and peculiar dimenſion of the ordinate or regular Triangle (and of all other regular Planes) as the dimenſion of regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Solids doth from that of Solids exactly regular: And ſo, as the ſolid content of any oblique, Scalene, or inclined Cone or Pyramid, &amp;c. is obtained both naturally and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, as that of a right, upright, or Iſoskelan Cone or Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid &amp;c. (as was ſhewed before in the dimenſion of a Cone, and ſhall be afterwards in the dimenſion of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids) So is here the ſuperficial content of any oblique Scalenal or irregular Triangle obtained (as well artificially as naturally) like that of an upright or Iſoskelan Triangle by any ſide thereof, put as the baſe, and the perpendicular lot fall from the oppoſite angle thereto, whether that ſide need to be continued out or produced, or not; ſeeing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Skalene Triangle is equal to an Iſoskelan, having the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29488:56"/> ſame baſe and perpendicular of altitude, (or they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted upon the ſame baſe, or equal baſes, and in the ſame Parallels, as <hi>Euclid,</hi> and his interpreters do ſpeak) by <hi>E 1. p.</hi> 37. and 38. as every oblique or Skalene Cone and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, &amp;c. is equal to a right, or Iſoskelan Cone and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, upon the ſame (or equal) baſe, and of the ſame alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by the reaſon of <hi>E. 12, p.</hi> 11. and 14. beforecited in the Cone, &amp;c. and <hi>p.</hi> 5. and 6. afterwards in the Pyramids, &amp;c. And now the Line of meaſure, for the performing of this latter or general artificial dimenſion of Triangles, wil be the ſame with that, which was noted formerly for the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dimenſion of a Cone, by its ſide and baſial Periphery together, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Rational Line in general, 1.4142, &amp;c. √q 2.

                  <p>So that you may here ſee by theſe 4 Sections of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, how that theſe 5 bodies being deſcribed either within or about one Sphear, have only three ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribing or containing Circles, for their Baſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that which is for the <hi>Tetrahedrum</hi> is the largeſt; that for the <hi>Hexahedrum</hi> and <hi>Octahedrum</hi> are both one, and the next to it; and that which is for the <hi>Dodecahedrum</hi> and <hi>Icoſahedrum</hi> are alſo equal, and the leaſt of all; which <hi>Euclid E. 14. p.</hi> 5, and 21, ſpeaks of, only in reſpect of theſe bodie's inſcriptibility in one Sphear. As for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial or hedral inſcribed Circles of theſe 5 Bodies, whether inſcribed in, or circumſcribed about one Sphear; there is no ſuch parity or agreement amongſt them, but they are all different one from another.</p>
                  <p>And as for the proportions of the ſides of theſe Bodies to the Diameters of their hedral Circle's whether circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing or inſcribed; and to their hedral Diameters or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars, &amp;c. the ſame are to be had in the three ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Planes before handled, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Trigon, Tetragon</hi> &amp; <hi>Pentagon:</hi> thoſe for the <hi>Tetrahedron, Octahedron</hi> and <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſahedron,</hi> out of the <hi>Trigon;</hi> thoſe for the <hi>Hexahedron,</hi> out of the <hi>Tetragon;</hi> and thoſe for the <hi>Dodecahedron,</hi> out of the <hi>Pentagon;</hi> But indeed, that of the <hi>Hexahedron's</hi> ſide to its hedral ambient Circle's Dimetient (or its hedral Diameter) <hi>&amp; é contra;</hi> is alſo noted in the 15. and 17. Sections.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the linear proportions, in reſpect of the ſeverall lines of Dimenſion in theſe Bodies, being conſidered both ſimply or abſolutely in themſelves, and alſo as being inſcribed and circumſcribed, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Diameter of the Sphear circumſcribing and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29488:107"/> inſcribed. And from theſe we ſhal proceed to the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, in reſpect of the Circumference anſwering to the ſaid Sphear's Diameter, which I have not yet found touched upon by any man, in any kind whatſoever. And therefore.</p>

                  <p>But here note, that an Iron-Sphear of 4 inches the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral magnitude in <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> his meaſure, wil weigh with him, 12<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. 2. ounc. 1 ſcrup. 14 gr. and 2/37 of a grain; for ſo I find it to be by the former proportional numbers, by comparing this Sphear with a Sphear of Tinne of the ſame diametrall magnitude, according as <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his foreſaid book, and from him Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> in his fore-named book: and which is alſo expreſly noted by <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> in a Table, wherein he hath ſet down the weights of a <hi>Sphear,</hi> in all the foreſaid Metals, from 1/4 of an inch the diametral magnitude, to 12 inches, or the whole Foot, proceeding all along by quarters of inches. But now 9<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. <hi>avoirdupois</hi> is in our Troy-weight, by <hi>Aſſize</hi> or <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths</hi> weight (according to the commonly received pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the <hi>Pound-avoirdupois</hi> to the <hi>Pound-troy,</hi> 60 to 73) but 10 57/60 pounds, or 10.95 <hi rend="sup">li</hi>. exactly; which is 10 pounds, 11 2/5 or 11.4 ounces; or according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diviſion of the ounce-troy by penny-weights, is 10<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. 11 oun. and 8 penny-weights exactly.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> divides a Pound into 12 ounces; an ounce into 24 ſcruples; and a ſcruple into 24 grains: ſo that his ounce weigheth 576 grains, and his pound, 6912 grains: And we divide our Pound-troy, into 12 ounces (as he doth his pound) but the ounce-troy we uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29488:122"/> into 20 penny-weights, and a penny-weight into 24 grains, ſo that our ounce-troy weigheth but 480 grains, and conſequently our Pound-troy 5760 gr. All which ſheweth, that either his <hi>Weight,</hi> or <hi>Meaſure,</hi> or rather both of them, do differ from ours, as I ſhal further ſhew: As for the <hi>Meaſure</hi> which hee uſeth, he ſaith it to be the ancient <hi>Romane Foot,</hi> divided into 12 <hi>unciae,</hi> or inches as ours is, and which by his deſcription and delineation thereof, in his forementioned book, ſeemeth to differ but very little from our Engliſh Foot, (if any thing at all) and that deficiently, and which Mr <hi>Oughtred</hi> in his forenamed book alſo obſerveth: But Mr. <hi>John Greaves</hi> ſometimes Profeſſour of Geometry in <hi>Greſham Colledg London,</hi> and now Profeſſour of Aſtronomy <note place="margin">Concerning the magnitude of the Romane Foot.</note> in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> hath in his Diſcourſe of the <hi>Roman Foot,</hi> &amp;c.

For although Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> doth conclude upon the ſame Meaſure of the Roman Foot, which (he ſaith) <hi>Ghetal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> doth, (for the trueſt Meaſure) yet if we compare their draughts or delineations of the half Foot, together, (in their foreſaid books) we ſhal find that of Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> to be ſhorter then that of <hi>Ghetaldus,</hi> by almoſt 1/8 of <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> his Inch, as it is there ſet out; or 1/10 of our Engliſh inch exactly.

                  <p>Now the <hi>Foot</hi> which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> (among ſuch a diverſity of opinions concerning the true Roman Foote, as are to be found, and ſo many Feet as are taken to be Romane) pitcheth upon for the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and true Roman Foot, (being led not only by the anthorities of <hi>Ghetaldus,</hi> and divers other learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men, (as he ſaith) but alſo by his own obſervations and experience) is that which is commonly called by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Pes Colotianus,</hi> from the place where it is (or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was) to be found, namely, <hi>in hortis Colotianis</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Monument of <hi>Coſſutius</hi> (which now he ſaith to be remov'd thence) <note place="margin">The Roman and Engliſh Foot compared together.</note> which <hi>Foot</hi> he comparing with our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Foot, which he took from the iron-Yard, or Standard of 3 Feet, at the <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (for there is no ſingle Foot-ſtandard) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be 967 ſuch parts, as the Engliſh Foot contains 1000; and ſo the Engliſh Foot to contain 1034.13, ſuch as the

                  <p>But now to return a little to our foregoing work of the artificiall dimenſion, or diametral and Circumferentiall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a Sphear of caſt-iron, for the weight thereof, which as we ſhewed before by the Integer of weight it ſelf (or by librall weight) So we will next ſhew how to perform the ſame by the compoſing, denominate parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of immediatly, <hi>viz.</hi> ounces avoirdupoiz (or uncial weight)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29488:138"/> And the Line or Scale of equal parts for this purpoſe, in reſpect both of the foreſaid common Tenent of the weight of an iron-Sphear or bullet, and alſo our own experiment, I finde (according to the reaſon of the precedent ſecond Theoreme, and alſo our generall reaſon) to be for the Diameter of ſuch a Sphear, (as to a centeſimal partition of the meaſure given) 0.76 inch, which is but very little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 3/4 of an inch: and the Line for the Circumference, according to the common Tenent, to be 2.40 inches <hi>ferè,</hi> and according to our experiment, 2.39 inches <hi>ferè,</hi> (ſo that here alſo one and the ſame Line of meaſure may indifferently ſerve in both) which two Lines being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the former, and then the Diameter or Circumference be taken by their proper reſpective Line or Scale, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the ſame ſhal be the weight of the Sphear or Bullet in ounces and decimal parts immediatly: For ſo the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the foreſaid bullet of 9li. and 2 oun. <hi>ferè</hi> avoirdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois, <hi>(viz.</hi> 9.123626 <hi>li. ferè)</hi> being 4 inches, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, 12.57 <hi>ferè,</hi> wil be found each of them, by their proper cubatorie Line or Scale, for unciall gravity, (being made 100 parts) to be 5.27 <hi>ferè,</hi> which cubed, yields 146.363183 <hi>ferè,</hi> for the weight of the Bullet in ounces, which exceedeth the true weight being 145.978009 oun. by 0.385174 oun. <hi>ferè,</hi> which by converſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, yieldeth about 6 drams, and which in a thing of this nature is not conſiderable: But yet if we wil ſtand more preciſely uppon the weight of this Bullet, if then we divide the two foreſaid artificiall Lines of meaſure for this purpoſe into more parts, as 1000 (for the naturall Line, or the Inch being ſo divided, the artificial Line wil be thereof, for the Diameter, 0.760 <hi>ferè,</hi> and for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, 2.387 <hi>ferè)</hi> &amp; ſo meaſure the Diameter &amp; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of this Sphear or bullet thereby, we ſhal find the

                  <p>And ſo again in the other Bullet of <hi>15li.</hi> &amp; 12 1/4 oun. avoir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dupoiz (or 252.25 ounces) weighed by us; if the Diameter or Circumf. noted formerly, be taken by theſe Lines under a centeſimall diviſion, they wil be found each of them to be 6.32 <hi>ferè,</hi> whoſe Cube is 252.435968 oun. <hi>ferè,</hi> which exceedeth the true weight, only 0.185968 oun. which by converſion, gives near upon 3 drams, and which is not conſiderable: But being meaſured by the ſame Lines under a milleſimall partition, they wil be found each of them, 6.318, which cubed, affords, 252.196389. &amp;c. ounces, which now wants of the true weight, not fully one dram being but 0.86 dr.</p>
                  <p>And ſo alſo if the Diameter or Circumference of this Bullet be taken by their proper reſpective Lines of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for librall weight beforegoing <hi>(viz.</hi> 1.91 inch, for the Diameter, and 6.01 inches, for the Circumference) the ſame wil be found ſeverally (according to a centeſimal partition of the Lines) 2.51 <hi>ferè,</hi> whoſe Cube is 15.813|251 <hi>ferè</hi> for the weight of the bullet, (which by reduction is <hi>15li.</hi> 13 oun. and 0.19 dr. avoirdupois) exceeding the true librall weight, <hi>viz.</hi> 15.765625<hi>li.</hi> (or 15<hi>li.</hi> and 12.25 oun.) only 0.047626<hi>li. ferè,</hi> which by converſion into the proper parts of this weight, gives about 3/4 of an ounce, <hi>viz.</hi> 12.19 dr. But being meaſured by the ſaid Lines in a milleſimal partition, (for the natural Line, or the <hi>Inch,</hi> being 1000 parts, the artificiall Line wil be thereof for the Diameter, 1.914, and for the Circumference 6.014 <hi>ferè)</hi> they wil be found ſeverally, 2.507, which cu

                  <p>Now if any ſhall upon occaſion, make uſe of the Troy-weight in a Spheare of this <note place="margin">The artificiall Lines of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the moſt ſpeedy diſcovering of the weight of a Spheare or Bullet of caſt-Iron, in Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight, both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brall and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> metall (though indeed this kind of weight is not uſuall for any Metall beſides Gold and Silver, as I have noted before) then the artficial Lines of meaſure for the ſpeedy diſcovering of the weight thereof by the diameter, wil be 1.794 inch for librall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight, and by the Circumference, 5.636 inches: And the Lines for unciall weight, wil be for the Diameter, 0.784 inch <hi>ferè,</hi> and for the Circumference, 2.462 inches.</p>
                  <p>And now albeit no art or induſtry of man, can make a Spheare of metall or other matter, ſo very exact and preciſe indeed, as it ought to be (according as I noted before from <hi>Ghetaldus)</hi> Yet conſidering that the weight of this and the other coarſer kind of Metals in any thing, is not ſo preciſely ſtood upon as the weight of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> (being preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Metals) So the exactneſſe of a Sphericall body made of any of them for ordinary uſe (as a <hi>Cannon-bullet,</hi> which is commonly made of caſt-iron, as I noted before) is not ſo much ſtood upon, ſo as it come ſomthing neer the ſame: and indeed there is hardly any Cannon-bullet, or other bullet for ſhooting, but is ſo round (being caſt in a Mould) as that the Eye can hardly adjudge or diſcerne it to be not exactly orbicular or ſphericall; and ſo the weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can be very litle miſtaken, being obtained by the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Circumference of the ſame, taken in a certaine ſet Meaſure, either naturall, as Inches, or the like; or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as deduced therefrom, according as I have here ſhewed

And which ſeverall dimenſions with many other the like metrical Concluſions pertaining hereunto, and the Converſe of the ſame (and all cheifly in reference to Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery) I will next expreſſe proportionally by Number, (from our foregoing experiments) according to the aforeſaid Metall and Meaſure commonly uſed in this thing, and the Weight both <hi>Avoirdupoiz</hi> and <hi>Troy,</hi> and in each of theſe, both by the librall and unciall-weight together, which in the ſeverall Sections of proportions following, are (for brevity-ſake) noted by the letters of diſtinction, <hi>l,</hi> and <hi>u.</hi>

                     <p>And all theſe things, together with the like in the other Figures, before-mentioned, may be yet more readily obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that according to our generall ground and reaſon of this artificiall Dimenſion (or of our artificiall metricall Lines) which was formerly ſaid to conſiſt in unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For as in our particular, partiall, or ſpeciall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, every particular <hi>Meaſure</hi> propounded (as the prime or naturall Rational Line) being conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its Parts, (compoſing or conſtituting, or otherwiſe dividing) every particular kind of Figure, or figurate Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, meaſurable in this way, was conſequently ſaid to be conſidered in the firſt or ſecond Power of the ſame (as in the powers of <hi>Number)</hi> according to the nature and kind of the Dimenſion; for the producing of the artificiall
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29488:148"/> Lines, (according to the three foregoing Theoremes) So here in our generall Reaſon, or Reaſon of the <hi>Whole,</hi> or of <hi>Unity;</hi> every <hi>Meaſure</hi> being conſidered in it ſelf ſimply and abſolutely, (as was formerly declared) every ſuch figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Magnitude (as aforeſaid) is to be conſidered according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the like Powers of Unity (as of the whole intire Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in generall) according to the nature of the Dimenſion. And ſo again, as in the performance of theſe Dimenſions, by the naturall Meaſure propoſed (or the prime Rationall Line in generall) in an Arithmeticall manner, by way of Proportion (according as hath been ſhewed in the ſeverall dimenſions beforegoing, among the dimenſionall Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) for the more immediate producing of the ſides of the Squares and Cubes, &amp;c. equal to the Figures propoſed to be meaſured, and which are immediatly given by our artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Lines of meaſure; we begin with Unity ſimple, and proceed from that to Number ſimple or linear, being ſome Root of a Figurate Number ſuperficial or ſolid; &amp; ſo to the figurate Number it ſelf; as from ſome dimenſional line of a Figure (by which the ſame is propoſed to be meaſured in a quadratary or cubatory manner, according to the nature of the Dimenſion; or by which the ſide of the equal Quadrat or Cube of the Figure is to be produced, either naturally in an arithmetical analogicall manner, as aforeſaid; or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, by a Line of meaſure convenient for the purpoſe) to the ſide of the equal Quadrator Cube; and ſo come to the Content of the Figure it ſelf? Or we come to the ſame more immediatly, and alſo moſt naturally and properly; procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Unity</hi> taken in the power thereof, prime or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, (according to the nature of the dimenſion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) to Number figurate, and then from that to the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent Root thereof; as from ſome dimenſional Line of a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:29488:149"/> Figure, in the aforeſaid powers thereof, to the Figure it ſelf; and then from that to the ſide of the equall Quadrat or Cube. So in this (for the immediate producing of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall Lines) we proceed from Unity figurate in the firſt or ſecond power thereof, according to the nature of the Dimenſion, to a Number figurate or potentiall, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from that to the correſpondent Root thereof; as from every kind of Figurate Magnitude in general, falling under our artificiall Dimenſion, to the like powers of ſome one of its dimenſional lines by which it is propoſed to be thus meaſured (or ſquared and cubed, or otherwiſe artificially meaſured, according to the nature and kind of the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude propounded, and of the Dimenſion it ſelf) and ſo from thence to the ſaid dimenſionall line it ſelf of the Figure, for the artificiall Line of meaſure required: which as in all exactly ordinate or regular Figures, it is but one ſuch line ſimply; ſo in all regular like-Figures it is of two together according as we have lately ſhewed. And ſo we might hereupon raiſe a 4th. and generall Theoreme, if it were needfull; but that which I have already ſaid concerning the ſame, is very ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>And what hath bin here ſpoken for ſolid Figures, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their ſolid meaſure, is to be underſtood in the ſame accordingly, for gravity or weight (according to any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or other like ponderous matter propoſed) For as before, according to our particular or ſpeciall reaſon, every Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of weight whatſoever propoſed, was ſaid to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in its parts taken ſimply in number; and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind of metalline, or other like ponderous (regular and regular-like) Body, was accordingly to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſame, as in the like parts of Unity: So here the Integer of weight propounded, is to be conſidered ſimply

Mr. <hi>William Oughtred,</hi> a reverend Divine, and moſt eminent Mathematician, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, after ſome experiments made by him to find out the ſolid content of this <hi>Gallon</hi> in inches, beſides the experiments of ſome others which came to his ſight, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome difficulty therein, in regard both of the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he obſerved to be uſually in the ſeverall Standard-Gallons which he met with, and alſo their diſagreement one from another in their Contents, as himſelf confeſſeth and declareth in his foreſaid book of the Circles of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Part 1. chap.</hi> 9. looketh back there to the firſt ground and principle of our Engliſh Meaſuring from Barley-corns: and ſo at length he commeth to a rationall conjecture of the <hi>Ale-gallon</hi> (and that very neatly, and prety nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as I ſhal ſtraightway ſhew) in cubique inches, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>John Reynolds</hi> aforenamed alſo, (who ſeemeth to have been as induſtrious in this, as in many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall experiments) wil have this <hi>Gallon</hi> to contain 288 3/4 cubique inches; holding that the Wine-gallon (which he ſtrongly affirmeth to be 231 inches) is to the Ale-gallon in ſuch proportion preciſely, as 4 to 5; or rather for the reduction of Wine-meaſure to Ale-meaſure, as 5 to 4; which is according to Mr. <hi>John Goodwyn</hi> long agoe, in his little Tract entituled, <hi>A Table of gauging,</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 50 years ſince, and dedicated to the then Lord Major and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London:</hi> wherein he ſhewing how to reduce Wine-meaſure into Ale-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp; contrà;</hi> ſaith, that 5 gallons of wine-meaſure make but 4 gallons of Ale-meaſure: with which very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agrees the opinion (not certain experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perhaps) of ſome others, who wil <note place="margin">This Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks to Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> as himſelf hath told me.</note> make this Gallon to contain juſt 288 inches upon this ground, that a cube-Foot ſhould hold in its concave capacity juſt 6 Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallons, and ſo conſequently one ale-gallon muſt contain juſt 288 inches, which that learned gentleman Mr. <hi>Edm.

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:29488:152"/>
                  <p>Now as for Mr. <hi>Oughtred's</hi> Ale-gallon of 272 1/4 inches, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> indeed alloweth of ſuch a Gallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure, but not for any liquid thing, but for drie things, as Corne, Coals, Salt, and other dry things meaſurable by this kind of Meaſure; and ſo calleth it the drie Gallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure: And thereupon he wil have to be 3 ſeverall Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons (or other like Meaſures) one for <hi>Wines,</hi> (which alſo ſerveth for oiles, ſtrong-waters and the like) Another for <hi>Ale</hi> and <hi>Beer,</hi> and a third for <hi>Corne, Coales,</hi> and the like; and this he maketh leſſer then the Ale-meaſure, whereas ſurely it ſhould rather be greater, if there be any difference at all between them: And theſe three ſeverall Gallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſures, he compareth together, or differenceth by theſe three Numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> 28, 33, 35. as to ſhew their proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one to another: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Wine-Gallon</hi> (231) to the dry Gallon-meaſure (272.25) as 28 to 33. which is ſo in the leaſt terms, rationall or abſolute; but otherwiſe in the leaſt proportionall termes, irrationall or unabſolute, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or limited, I find them to be as 7 to 8.25. And the ſaid <hi>Wine-Gallon</hi> to his <hi>Ale-Gallon</hi> (288.75) as 28 to 35, which in the leaſt rationall termes, is indeed as 4 to 5; but otherwiſe in the leaſt termes irrationall (but finite or limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) I find them to be as 1. to 1.25. and which again is integrally rationall, 100 to 125: And the dry-Meaſure to the Ale-meaſure, as 33 to 35, which cannot be abbreviated in terms rational.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, evil Cuſtome ſeemeth to have brought up three ſuch diſtinct meaſures (and which the foreſaid Mr. <hi>Wingate</hi> hath alſo expreſſed to me) For at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> where is generally holden to be the true Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard for theſe Meaſures, and ſo from which all others of the like kind throughout the Kingdome, are uſually deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:29488:152"/> there are but two ſuch diſtinct Meaſures only (as we have been there informed for a certain truth) <hi>viz.</hi> one for <hi>Wines</hi> (and ſo for ſtrong-waters, oiles, and the like) and the other for <hi>Ale, Beer,</hi> and drie things, as Corn, Coales, Salt, and the like; which latter is commonly called the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter Meaſure,</hi> and from this are taken the bigger drie Meaſures, as the <hi>half-Peck</hi> and <hi>Peck,</hi> and ſo on to the <hi>Buſhell,</hi> which is the greateſt of our drie Meaſures: Which ſaid Standard-Meaſures at the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> the foreſaid Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> confeſſed to me (going to him on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome ſatisfaction from him about the Wine and Ale or Beer-meaſures (which was in <hi>June</hi> 1646, and then he gave me in writing under his hand, the ſolid content of the Ale-gallon to be 288 3/4 inches, and ſo its Proportion to the Wine-gallon, to be exactly as 5 to 4 (or for the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ale-meaſure to wine-meaſure, as 4 to 5) that he had never made any triall of them, (neither could I find that any other had, or if they had, it was ſurely to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) but only of thoſe Meaſures in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> (which he pleads for to be the moſt ancient and true ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Meaſures) and at <hi>Cowpers-Hall,</hi> and ſome other ſuch places, which ſeem to be but ſome particular Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary meaſures, differing from the generally received Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-meaſures at the <hi>Guild-hall.</hi>

                  <p>And therefore to be fully ſatisfied in this point, concerning the true <hi>Wine,</hi> and Ale or Beer Meaſures, according to the common Standards, (and more eſpecially about the Ale or Beer-meaſure, finding ſuch a diverſity of opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, and in ſo vaſt a difference, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Mr. Oughtred's</hi> and <hi>Mr. Reynold's</hi> Ale-gallon, being 16 1/2 cube-inches) My ſelf and one <hi>Mr. Baptiſt Sutton,</hi> (a man well known in the City among artiſts)
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:29488:153"/> did agree to go together to the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> where he was wel acquainted with the keeper of the Standard-meaſures and Weights, who otherwiſe I found to be very nice and ſcrupulous in ſhewing of them; and for our further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein, we made known our intention to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Mr. Wingate,</hi> who much approved of the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his deſire alſo of it: And ſo <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1645; we repaired together to the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> carrying along with us two large ſquare glaſſe-vials, which we firſt weighed in a Gold-ſmiths Ballance by Troy-weights, (as being the beſt) which were ſupooſed to be exact enough; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards filling the two braſſe-ſtandard-Gallons for <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer,</hi> with fair water from the Ciſterne, and that with all poſſible preciſeneſſe, we powred forth the ſame with the like accurateneſſe, into the ſaid two glaſſe vials, and then weighed the Glaſſes with the water in them by the ſame weights: and ſo comparing the weight of each Glaſſe alone, with the weight of the glaſſe and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, we found the Wine-Gallon of water to weigh 117 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>/4 ounces-Troy, and the Ale-gallon of water 140 9/16 ounces, (which laſt, according to the common divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Ounce-troy by penny-weights, is 140 ounces, 11 penny-weights, and a quarter) which do hold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion (from the leſſer to the greater) as 10000 11937, which comes very near, as 5 to 6. Then ſeing that Weight and ſolid meaſure do hold in proportion one to another, ſo as that one may be deduced from the other, as I have ſhewed before; if we compare theſe two Gallon-weights of water, with ſeverall experiments made by my ſelf, and <hi>Mr. Reynolds,</hi> ſeverally (and conferred together) for the finding out of the true weight of water in relation to its ſolid meaſure in inches, (or for the comparing of its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity

                  <p>Now as to the foreſaid experiments; the ſaid, <hi>Mr. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> did firſt (amongſt other things to this purpoſe) cauſe a Veſſel to be made of Wood, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <note n="*" place="margin">

And he not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this own experiment, he cauſed ſuch another Veſſel to be made, every way like and equall in its dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the former, and that by the ſame Workman; which he filling with the like water, found it to agree in weight exactly with the former. But yet he not reſting fully ſatisfied with theſe two experiments, he procured ſuch another Veſſel to be made, by another Workman, of the very ſame Dimenſions with the former; which he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29488:154"/> with the like water as aforeſaid, found the weight of the ſaid water alone to be 12<hi>li.</hi> and very near 6 oun. Troy, (or 12 1/2 pounds-Troy <hi>ferè)</hi> exceeding the former weight about 3/4 of an ounce, and which he conceived to be the truer, (notwithſtanding the exact agreement between the two former experiments) by comparing theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with ſome other of the like kind, which had been made before by himſelf, or ſome other body; And this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of weight ſeemeth to proceed chiefly from ſome difference of meaſure in the Inch, by which the two firſt Veſſels, and the laſt were made, being done by two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Workmen. And therefore (conſidering the difficulty in a work of this nature, in reſpect of the nicety and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the experiment) he comparing theſe with ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I had then made by the bye, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; we concluded together at length, that the neareſt and indifferenteſt weight of the water exactly filling up the foreſaid Veſſel of 283 1/2 cubick or ſolid inches, would be 12<hi>li.</hi> and 5 1/2 oun. Troy (or 149 1/2 ounces) and this to ſtand good.</p>
                  <p>And then after this, I got an exact cubical Veſſel to be made of throughly ſeaſoned wood, with all the accurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; preciſeneſſe that could be, being 6 inches the in-ſide, (or the baſe thereof exactly 6 inches ſquare) and ſo the whole Cube in its concave capacity, exactly 216 inches; and which then, to keep it from ſucking in water in any part, or any water to ſoak into it, was well primed all within, with a thin oile-colour (yet of a ſufficient body) having afterwards a Cover put on it, with a little hole in the middle thereof, about 3/4 of an inch wide, as the foreſaid Veſſels of Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> had: And which cubicall Veſſell I then filling with all the exactneſſe and preciſeneſſe that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29488:154"/> might be, with fair ſetled Rain-water, at <hi>Gold-ſmiths-Hall;</hi> and ſo having the ſame as exactly weighed by the Standard Troy-weights; I found the weight of the water alone (deducting the weight of the empty Veſſel it ſelfe firſt of all had, from the weight of the veſſel and water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) to be upon the very point of 114 ounces, or 9 <hi>li.</hi> &amp; 1/2. without any conſiderable difference therefrom: and thus I found it to be, at two ſeveral trials. Now according to the two firſt obſervations of <hi>Mr. Reynolds,</hi> aforeſaid; 216 inches of the forenamed water, ſhould weigh 113.7 oun. Troy, <hi>viz.</hi> 113 oun. and 14 p. w. which comes ſhort of our obſervation, by about a quarter of an ounce; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his laſt obſervation the ſame ſhould weigh 114.3 oun. <hi>ferè, viz.</hi> 114 ounces, and neer upon 6 p. w. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thè weight found by us, juſt ſo much as the other wants of the ſame; So that the weight of this cubical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of water produced by our experiment, falleth directly in the middle between the ſeverall weights of the ſame deduced from his foreſaid experiments, upon one and the ſame kind of veſſel. And according to this our moſt exact obſervation; the weight of 283.5 cubick or ſolid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the foreſaid water, (being the content of each of <hi>Mr. Reynolds</hi> his th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And ſo now according to this experimental Concluſion of mine own; I ſhall proceed exactly in the ſubſequent operations upon the Wine and Ale-Gallons: For ſo the weights of the two ſeverall Gallons of water aforeſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared ſeverally with this experiment, the ſolid ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity

And ſo likewiſe may the ſame be very neerly confirmed by the <hi>Wine-Gallon,</hi> according to our 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and moſt plain demonſtrative expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment for the ſame (by the braſſe concave Cube) by which the ſolid meaſure thereof being found 224 inches; and by the three former experiments (conferred together) the weight of the water contained exactly in the ſaid Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon-veſſel, very neer about 9 <hi>li.</hi> and 10 oun. Troy, or 118 oun. the weight of the water exactly contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid large cubicall Veſſel of 216 inches, will be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (according to the foreſaid proportionality) very nearly as before, <hi>viz.</hi> 113.78 oun. which wants of the true weight found by us, but 0.22 oun. and which is only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4 p. w. or 1/5 of an ounce-troy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover for a further confirmation of this thing, and that very nearly, I ſhal produce another experiment, which I made upon the foreſaid braſſe-Cubicall Veſſel of 64 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: For ſo ſoon as I and Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> aforenamed, had meaſured out the Standard <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Ale-Gallons</hi> thereby,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:29488:162"/> as aforeſaid; we firſt weighed the ſaid concave <hi>Cube</hi> by a ſmall Ballance of his, with Troy-weights, and then again filled the ſame with fair water, as preciſely as poſſibly we could; which we alſo weighing together, found the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional or differentiall weight (take it which way you wil) to be (as nearly as we could poſſibly gueſſe) 33.5 ounces, for the water alone; And afterwards I being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to make a further and exacter triall of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I carried this <hi>Cube</hi> unto <hi>Goldſmiths-hall,</hi> where I procured the ſame to be weighed firſt alone, by the exact Standard Troy-weights, with all the accuratneſſe that might be; and then filling the <hi>Cube</hi> with fair ſetled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as preciſely as poſſibly I could, had the ſame weighed together, with the like accuratneſſe; and ſo by collating theſe two ſeverall weights together, found the weight of the 64 inches of water alone, to be exactly in a manner as before, <hi>viz.</hi> 33.5 oun. (or but ſome few grains over) and this the <hi>Aſſay-maſter</hi> judged to be the neareſt weight thereof that could be given, conſidering the wideneſſe of the Veſſel, to be ſuch, (and that fully open on one ſide) as that ſome few drops of water more or leſſe in the filling thereof, were not very diſcernable. Now according to our former experiments, the weight of this cubicall body of water, wil be found, 33.7 oun. troy; (or rather 33.8 <hi>ferè)</hi> which comes prety near the other: but indeed this laſt being deduced from our experiments made by <hi>Veſſels</hi> of a much greater capacity (or by a greater quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) muſt needs be the trueſt; ſo that the other is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wanting of the true weight.

And thus the quantity of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall gauging-Line for Wine-meaſure (according to the Gallon of 224 inches) wil be 6.58 inches; and for Ale or Beer meaſure, (according to the Gallon of 266 inches) 6.97 inches. But yet conſidering the loſſe that happens in Wine by the dregs or lees thereof, and much more in Ale and Beer, by the frothing and otherwiſe: therefore we have thought it meet and convenient, to allow one inch more at leaſt in the meaſure of the Wine-gallon, and 4 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Meaſure of the Ale or Beer-gallon; and ſo make the Wine-gallon to be 225 inches, and the Ale-gallon
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:29488:164"/> 270 inches; which we conceive to be the moſt neer and indifferent meaſures (in a generall reſpect,) for theſe two Gallons, that may be: And theſe two do hold in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exactly as 5 to 6: And in this proportion we might ſuppoſe they were firſt intended, conſidering how very neer the ſame, the true Contents thereof do come: And therefore according to theſe two meaſures, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the worke of Gauging. And the length of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall gauging-Line ſerving hereunto, will be for Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure, 6.59 inches, and for Ale or Beere-meaſure, 7.00 inches: which being divided decimally (as all the former Lines) into 10, or rather 100 parts, or more, (and ſo turned over ſeverall times upon a Rod or Rular of a convenient length) and then the <hi>Diameters</hi> and lengths of Veſſels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereby; their Contents ſhall be obtained in Gallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure immediatly, as the ſolid Contents of Cylinders were formerly had, according to any Meaſure appointed.</p>

And this I ſhall ſhew from our forementioned experiments made upon the moſt common liquid Body, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of its gravity and magnitude, or ponderall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſionall quantity together; drawing firſt from thence ſome apt and brief Notes or Concluſions, for the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ready performing of this kind of Dimenſion. And ſo from thence we gather, the neareſt and trueſt weight of one Inch cubique or ſolid of clear or fair ſetled water in generall, to be 0.527 oun. troy, or rather, 0.528 <hi>ferè,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 0.52777, &amp;c. which is but little more then halfe an ounce, it being (by converſion or reduction into the proper parts of this weight) 4 dr. or 10 penny-weight and 13 gr. preciſely in a manner. And yet afterwards, for further curioſity in this thing, I cauſed to be made of braſſe, a concave <hi>Cube</hi> of one inch, open on one ſide, but having a lid or Cover made very exact, to clap cloſe on it, with an hole in the middle thereof, no bigger, then to receive through it a ſmall drop of water, that ſo I might be able to fill the ſame preciſely to the leaſt drop: (but indeed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:29488:170"/> this <hi>Cube</hi> was made too ſcanty, and ſo wanted of it's true magnitude, as I found by comparing it with other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act cube-inches; and it being filled with fair water, and weighed by a very curions Ballance at <hi>Goldſmiths-hall,</hi> as preciſely as might be; the weight of the water alone, was but half an ounce troy, &amp; about 2 gr. over, and this I tried twice over: though yet for all this, I wel knew that the true weight of one inch of water (or of any other humid or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid body) could not be ſo exactly deduced from a Veſſel or Body of one inch only, as from a Veſſel or body contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many inches; in regard of the exceeding nicety and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the making of ſo ſmall a Veſſel, and then in the filling &amp; weighing of the ſame; over there is in a larger Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: &amp; for that in the filling of ſo ſmal a Veſſel, the leaſt drop of liquour more or leſs, is of ſome moment, wheras in a large Veſſel, a few drops more or leſſe are not conſiderable, ſo as to make any ſenſible or conſiderable difference in the weight of one inch being deduced therefrom. (Nor is our foreſaid cubical Veſſel of 64 inches, ſo very ſufficient for this purpoſe, as to ground ſo nice &amp; curious an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Concluſion thereupon.) And therefore we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed herein, <hi>à majori ad minus,</hi> from a greater quantity to a leſſe, both for the diſcovering of the weight by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (as before) and alſo of the Meaſure by the weight: and not <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> from a leſſe to a greater; for that wil not hold good in this thing. But indeed in a ſolid Body, of what matter ſoever it be, the thing wil hold juſt contrary to the former, in both the foreſaid reſpects: For herein, we muſt rather go <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: And ſo the weight of one inch cubick or ſolid, may more exactly be had from a Body of one inch cubick only (being exactly made, and which I find is hard to do) then
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:29488:171"/> from a Body of many inches; and conſequently, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or ponderoſity of any bigger body (of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) may be had moſt exactly and ſpeedily therefrom: For thus <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> in his experiments before-mentioned, for the comparing of ſundry Metals together, in gravity and magnitude, and ſo to determine exact proportions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; began upon ſmal quantities, and from thence deduceth greater quantities: And ſo in particular, for finding the gravities of ſpherical Metalline bodies by their Diametrall magnitudes, hee firſt began with a Sphear of a ſmall magnitude; Or rather, becauſe hee could not have ſuch a body exactly made (as I noted formerly) he procured a metalline Cylinder to be made, (which might be more exactly done) of equall Diameter and altitude; and the ſame to be but two inches from the Roman Foot; and thereby he obtained the gravity of a Sphear, of the ſame metal, whoſe Diameter was equal with the Diameter, and altitude of the Cylinder, &amp;c. and from this he deduceth the gravity of any other Sphear of the ſame Metal, of what magnitude ſoever, as I formerly ſhewed. And ſo likewiſe have I ſeen our Countrey-man Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> beforenamed, in making the like experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for finding the proportions of gravity, &amp;c. in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, perform the ſame by Bodies of one Inch cubique only, holding it a ſurer way, ſo to obtain the weight of one inch cubick or ſolid of any Metall (or other ſolid ſubſtance) then by a body of a greater magnitude: Though yet (for mine own part) I conceive there may not be altogether ſo much curioſity or difficulty in this, as in the former; but that the weight of a ſolid body of one inch in magnitude, may as (if not more) nearly be deduced from the weight of a body of a greater magnitude or dimenſion, (of the ſame matter)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29488:171"/> as the weight of a liquid or humid body of one inch in magnitude or bulk, can be deduced from the weight of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid body (of the ſame kind) of a greater bulk or craſſitude; by how much, the weight of any ſolid body in generall, may be had more exactly then the weight of any liquid body; ſith that a ſolid body is weighed immediatly by it ſelf in the Ballance or Scale, without the help of any other thing to contain it; whereas a liquid body (eſpecially one ſo thin and fluid as water is) cannot wel be weighed by it ſelf (unleſſe it be in a ſmal quantity) but by means of ſome Veſſel to hold it, whoſe weight muſt alſo be had firſt or laſt by it ſelf (though indeed, it is not abſolutely materiall or requiſite to take notice of the ſame, as to any certain, known, regular, denominate weights, unleſſe the Veſſel be laſt of all weighed by it ſelf, for otherwiſe any irregular indenominate weights wil ſerve to poize it, if it be firſt weighed alone, before it receive the liquid Body whoſe weight is required.

And the quantity of water ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the Veſſel, may be found, either by firſt weighing the Veſſel full of water, and then the Veſſel with the remainer of the water left therein, after the taking out of the ſolid body, (for here the weight of the Veſſell alone need not be had) whoſe difference of weight ſhal be the weight of the water effluxed: or elſe (which is much eaſier and exacter, eſpecially if the Veſſel be ſo great, as that it cannot conveniently be weighed) by making a ſmall hole near the top of the Veſſel, or a nick or notch in the very edge, brim, or top thereof; and ſo filling the Veſſel

And herein, it maketh no matter, whether the ſolid body be ſunk into the Veſſel of water, any lower then juſt to cover it, or not; for it comes all to one paſſe, ſeing that it ſtill takes up but the ſame room or place in the water; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cauſeth but the ſame quantity of water to flow out.

But this muſt be underſtood of ſuch a ſolid body or Magnitude, as is heavier then water; that is, being put therein, will ſinke, or be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down into the ſame, of its own accord: Whereas elſe, if it be a ſolid body which is lighter then the water, that is, being put into the ſame, will not ſink, or deſcend down of it ſelf; then the gravity of ſuch a portion of the water, as is equall in magnitude to this ſolid body, muſt (in this way) be had by the adjection or appoſition of ſome other ſolid body, which is weightier then water, (whoſe gravity both in the aire and water are firſt had, as alſo the gravity of the lighter body in the aire) ſo as theſe two ſeveral Solids being joyn'd together, may make up (as it were) one Body; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being let down into the water, may voluntarily ſink or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend:
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29488:175"/> And both which Solids thus put together in one, wil be lighter in the water, then the heavier Solid alone, (as <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> ſheweth in the fore-named place) And wil be alſo lighter therein, then they are in the air, (both their true weights being taken together) by ſo much, as is the gravity of the water equall in magnitude to them both, (according to that of a ſolid body alone which is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then water) And this ſhall exceed the gravity of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter equall in magnitude to the lighter body alone, by ſo much, as is the gravity of the water equall in magnitude to the heavier body; and therefore the gravity of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter equall in magnitude to the lighter body (which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) is thereby immediatly obtained. And what hath been here ſpoken concerning <hi>Water,</hi> the like underſtand of any other liquid or humid body, in which a ſolid body may be thus weighed.

            <p>But now, that I might be found not more wanting in the practice and experience of theſe things, then of the other before going (for with the bare ſpeculation of things I could never yet well content my ſelfe, though they were never ſo likely in themſelves, (as many men do, and ſo take up all
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29488:175"/> things upon truſt) I wil here produce a manifeſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by my ſelf, of both theſe waies. under one, in reference to the diſcovering <note place="margin">A double expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment upon the foregoing Concluſions. <hi>Apr.</hi> 12.1649.</note> of the dimenſionall quantity of a ſolid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by ſuch a body of water as is equall in magnitude thereto, whereby the verity of all theſe mathematicall Concluſions may plainly appear. And therefore to this end and purpoſe, I ſought to get ſome ſolid body of Metall or Stone, of a reaſonable bigneſſe, which might not ſuck or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive water into it, and be alſo wrought into ſome ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular form, as that the ſolid content thereof might be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained by a Line of meaſure, according to the plain and uſuall way of meaſuring, and alſo ſuch an one, as might eaſily be hanged in a ſtring; without any fear of ſlipping out when it was in the water; as ſome Priſmall or Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dricall body, or the like; but which (though with much ſeeking up and down) I could not meet with ready to my hand, nor otherwiſe eaſily obtain: And ſo after all this adoe, I could procure none that might any way ſerve the turn, but one which was of a ſphericall form, and that was a Marble-bullet, made as round and ſmooth as might wel be imagined, (and which therefore was the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for the performance of this experiment, that could be, being the moſt difficultly hung in a ſtring, of any other kind of body) whoſe diameter I therefore firſt took moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly by a Callaper Compaſſe, and applying the ſame to a Diagonal Scale of an <hi>Inch,</hi> I found it to be 4.95 inches, and from thence the ſolid Content, 63.5 inches: which being done; I immediatly carried the Bullet to <hi>Goldſmiths-hall</hi> (where I was to make my experiment) and there got the ſame exactly weighed in the Scale; and ſo found the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29488:176"/> weight thereof, 89 oun. 2 p. w. (which are 7<hi>li.</hi> 5.1 oun. troy) Then for the diſcovering of the weight thereof in water, as alſo for the performing of the other Concluſion, for the finding out of the quantity of water equall in magnitude thereunto, both under one: I got preſently an earthen Veſſell, very broad and deepe, which held about a good Paile-full and an half, or more; cauſing firſt a ſmall hole to be drilled through it neer the top, and then a pipe of Tinne to be fitted thereto, and faſtened therein ſo cloſe, as that no water might paſſe through the hole beſide the pipe; and then I next prepared ſeverall ſmall lines or ſtrings of horſe-taile haires twiſted together, with which I girted the Bullet ſeveral times about, till it would hang firmly, and not ſlip out (and which I found very tedious and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to doe, by reaſon of the ſmoothneſſe and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of the body, and the ſlipperineſſe of the horſe-haire together) continuing the ſaid ſtrings or lines out together from the bullet to a convenient length, and tying them together, whereby the bullet might hang down in the water from the Ballance: which done; I faſtened the ſaid ſtrings (not to one of the Scales, as <hi>Ghetaldus</hi> ſeemes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, but) to one end of the Beame, where the Scale is hung, which I conceived to be the beſt way; eſpecially conſidering the weightineſſe of the Body: And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that reſpect, it required a ſtrong Beame whereon to hang, and that the Scales belonging to the great Beame would be troubleſome, and an impediment in the way, in reſpect of their largeneſſe: therefore I, and the Aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of <hi>Gold-ſmiths-hall</hi> together, conceived it beſt to put in their place a ſmall paire of Scales, which might be ſufficient to hold the Weights; and ſo the Body might hang freely down by the Scale without interruption; which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29488:176"/> being done; I ſet the foreſaid earthen <hi>Veſſel</hi> under that end of the Beame on which the Body hung, and then filled the ſame with faire water exactly up to the hole therein, till the water entred the pipe, (letting it run a few drops till it ſtaied of it ſelfe, for ſo I was ſure of the exact filling thereof to a due height) under which I then ſet a glaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall with a little Funnell in it, which might receive the water forced out of the Veſſell by the bullet, to a drop; and then ſinking the ſaid Body gently into the water, (afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo much ſtring therein, as might keep it fully cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the time) I had the <hi>Weights</hi> put into the other Scale, together with neer about ſuch a quantity of horſe-haire, as was contained in the ſeveral ſmall ſtrings joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which the bullet hung (neglecting that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which was wound or wrapped about the bullet in the water, for the reaſon before alledged) and ſo the bullet hanging freely in the water, we found it to weigh 55 ounces and 3 quarters, Troy (which is 4 <hi>li.</hi> and 7.75 oun.) and thus I let it hang in the water duly poized, till all the water was run out into the Glaſſe, which it could make to flow out; for this water thus effluxed, was of equal mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude with the ſaid Bullet. And this being finiſhed I repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one part of my experiment the next day, by filling up the Veſſel againe to the hole thereof exactly as before; &amp; then ſetting another Glaſſe with the Funnell in it, under the pipe, I ſunk the ſaid bullet into the water, letting itabide therein, till it had forced out all the water that it could, to the laſt drop (not one drop running beſide the pipe) &amp; then afterwards weighing the ſaid ſeveral Glaſſes of water ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxed out of the Veſſel by meanes of the bullet, I found them to differ inſenſibly; the weight of the water alone
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:29488:177"/> being 33 ounces, and 8 p. w. or 33.4 oun. troy, (which nearly agrees with our experiment made upon the braſſe Cubicall Veſſel of 64 inches aforeſaid, whoſe water we found, to weigh 33.5 oun. troy) Now the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the weight of the Bullet in the air, or the Scale, 89.1 oun. (or 89 oun. 2 p. w) and its weight in the water, 55.75 oun. (or 55 oun. and 15 p. w.) is 33.35 oun. (or 33 oun. 7 p. w.) for the weight of the water equall in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude with the bullet; which you ſee differs (defectively) from the weight of the water forced out of the Veſſel by the bullet, only 1 p. w. which is not conſiderable: And yet had I been ſo curious in weighing the bullet in water, as to have put in the Scale where the weights were, the ſame quantity of horſe-hair, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed the ſolid Content thus found by water, I may adjudge to be the truer meaſure, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there was a ſmal flotting in one place of the bullet, which might well make the ſolid content thereof leſſer by ſo much then it was, being taken according to a full rotundity or ſphericalneſſe every way, without any flatting in the ſame, and according to which the Diameter was

            <p>And this way for diſcovering the meaſure of any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Solid, muſt needs be generally better then that which Mr. <hi>Diggs</hi> hath delivered in his <note n="*" place="margin">Pantomet. lib. 3. cap. 14.</note>

            <p>But now as for the difference of gravity in waters homogeneall, (or of the like kind and denomination) I ſhall prove the ſame by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from four ſeverall Fountains, or Springs (and partly from two Rivers) in comparing them with Rain-water ſeverall times: and which is as much as (if not much more then) any other hath done in this kind, that I could ever yet hear of: And the waters which I firſt tried by way of ponderall compariſon; were firſt, <hi>Rain-water,</hi> as being the Baſe of the Experiment, in regard of what hath been ſaid there of before; and ſo to which all the other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are here compared; and which I received into a clean Veſſel as it fell from the Clouds, that ſo I might have it as pure as might be, without the mixture of any earthly matter: And the Fountain-waters which I now uſed, were from the Conduit in <hi>Grayes-Inne</hi> Fields, commonly called by the name of <hi>Lambs-Condait,</hi> which is a pure Spring of it ſelf; and from the <hi>Standard</hi> in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> which is conveighed under ground by pipes, from a Spring at <hi>Padington,</hi> being a Village about 3 miles diſtant from <hi>London</hi> to the N-W.

            <p>And thus having diſcovered the difference of gravity in ſeverall waters by ſmaller Veſſels, (or quantities of water) I conceived it very convenient after all this, to make one experiment or obſervation more upon all the foreſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waters, by a much larger quantity; confidering that theſe ſmaller quantities were not ſo ſufficient to diſcover

            <p>But indeed, if vve ſhould have yet further tried the ſame by a larger quantity of the vvaters: then probably might the proportion have ſtill riſen higher; and ſo have come ſomevvhat neerer that of <hi>Snellius,</hi> according as vve have ſtill obſerved from our ſeveral experiments; that as the veſſel or quantity of each particular vvater hath been greater, ſo the higher hath riſen the proportion of gravity betvven them, (though very little) according as the difference of gravity hath become ſomevvhat greater then perhaps it ſhould: For that ſurely, vvhether the ſame be experimented by a leſſer or larger quantity; yet the ſame proportion of gravity ſhould ariſe, according as the the difference of gravity ſhould be proportionably the ſame; and vvhich hath neerly happened in theſe ſeveral obſervations by ſeveral quantities of vvaters, except thoſe of the firſt experimene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

And vvhich vvould continually happen, in caſe the gravity of each particular water could ſtill be taken in every ſeveral Veſſel, or Quantity, ſo very preciſely to the leaſt part of vveight, as might be imagined: but vvhich, conſidering that every Ballance (as an Inſtrument or Organ, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers parts) is continually ſubject to mutation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>And all thoſe artificiall Dimenſions which depend meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the cubing of ſome one number or term (ſuch as are of all ordinate or regular <hi>Solids,</hi> for their ſolid meaſure) wil be abſolved by one and the ſame extent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:29488:189"/> being trebled, or twice repeated upon the ſaid Line of artificiall Numbers, according to the foreſaid Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme (in a compound or double Multiplication) which wil be, as from an <hi>Unit,</hi> to the linear number or term taken by the artificiall Line of meaſure, or Line of Cubature, (for ſome dimenſionall line of a regular <hi>Solid</hi> given to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thereby, it repreſenting artificially the ſide of the equall Cube) ſo from thence to the Square thereof; and from that to the Cube, for the ſolid content.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe artificiall Dimenſions which conſiſt not of cubing, but yet of a twofold Multiplication; the one whereof is a Quadrature, (ſuch are of all regular-like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, as Cylinders, Cones, and the like) wil be abſolved by two ſeverall extents of the Compaſſes, each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubled or once iterated upon the ſaid Line of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; which wil be firſt, as from an <hi>Unit</hi> to the quadratary term taken by the artificiall Line of meaſure, repreſenting ſome dimenſionall line of the ordinate Baſe; So from that, to the Quadrat thereof, for the artificiall Baſe: Then, as from an <hi>Unit</hi> to that Quadrat; So from the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or term taken by the ſame artificiall Line of meaſure, for the <hi>Axis</hi> or Altitude of the ſolid Figure to be meaſured; to the ſolid area of the Figure.

And here, if the two foreſaid lines of a regular-like Solid, to wit, the <hi>Axis,</hi> &amp; the baſiall line (whatſoever it be) do happen to be equall (as they very rarely do) then wil the Dimenſion be cubicall, as that of an exactly ordinate Solid by ſome one of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſional lines; and ſo be abſolved upon the Line of Numbers accordingly.
